Custom personal dashboard displaying weather from an API, calendar, and photos

Simple dashboard that fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap and displays a forecast for the week, dynamically adding and updating card elements.

Also contains a custom built clock with the date, an embedded google calendar and grabs photos from my s3 bucket to display.
